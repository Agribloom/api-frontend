                    <strong>AgriBloom</strong> is an agric-tech platform that gives people the opportunity to participate in the agricultural sector by selecting the kind of farms they want to sponsor. We use the contributors’(“Sponsors”) funds to secure land, engage farmers, plant seeds, insure farmers and farm produce, complete a full farming cycle, sell harvests and then pay the Sponsor profits from a successfully harvested farming cycle. While this farm cycle is on-going, the Sponsors are able to keep track of the full-cycle by getting updates in text, pictures and videos.
                  </p>

                  <p>In these Terms of Use, we refer to those contributing funds as “Sponsors” and people who have opted in to only receive updates from the farm as “farm followers”. Other users of the Service and visitors to the Site are referred to collectively as “Users.” Information about happenings and progress reports on the farms are referred to as “farm updates”.A “farm cycle” refers to a complete farming season from planting to harvest and sales.</p>
